# Logo Generator

## Description

I wanted to create an application that will prompt the user multiple questions, and based on the answers given will generate a SVG logo to create one less stress for those busy entrepreneurs out there that just never have enough time! I learned about dynamic placements and the importance of error handling along with locating libraries.
